Step 1: Extract Proxy Voting Guidelines
Extract relevant proxy voting guidelines/rules from the following policy documents:

○ BlackRock: Responsible Investment Guidelines
○ Vanguard: Proxy Voting Policy

Include all information relevant to corporate customers seeking to understand each investor's
expectations and guidelines on various policy topics. Break down complex statements into
concise, digestible rules. Each rule should focus on a specific policy or decision point.
Examples:
● May vote AGAINST a non-executive director serving on more than 4 public boards
● Votes FOR shareholder proposals to declassify the board, unless the board provides a
strategic rationale for classification
● May vote AGAINST committee members responsible for CEO/management succession
if there are significant concerns regarding the planning efforts



Step 2: Categorize Guidelines
Organize the guidelines from Step 1 into a format that enhances usability and navigation for
customers. You can use any hierarchical breakdown of topics, categories, subcategories,
policies, etc that you think would be effective. The first goal of this categorization for users to be
able to find investors rules/guidelines easily by navigating these categorizations. The second
goal is so that the categories allow for users to see how investors’ rules/guidelines on the same
topic compare.
Examples of potential categorizations:
● Board Composition
● Executive Compensation
● Shareholder Proposals
● Board Gender Diversity
● ESG metrics in Compensation Plans
● Written Consent Proposals



Step 3: Apply Guidelines to Microsoft's Proxy Statement Information
Using the rules/guidelines extracted in Step 1, apply these rule/guidelines to the Microsoft Proxy
Statement 2024. The goal of this exercise is for a user to have the ability to see instances of
Microsoft violating BlackRock and Vanguard’s expectations.
Example: A flag is created because a director on Microsoft’s Board sits on five public company
boards and BlackRock will vote AGAINST a director that sits on more than four public company
boards.
We are not prescriptive on how this information is presented as long as it is clear how Microsoft
is or is not violating BlackRock and Vanguard’s expectations.
